# Automated-Email-Reporting-for-Finance-Team
I built a script that automatically sends finance reports by email, replacing the manual process of attaching files and sending them each week.

## Overview
This project is a Python script that sends finance reports automatically by email.  
It was created to reduce repetitive manual work and ensure the reports always arrive on time.

## Features
- Sends emails automatically with file attachments  
- Can be scheduled to run daily or weekly  
- Reduces time spent on manual reporting  

## Tech Used
- Python (smtplib, email, schedule)  

## How It Works
1. The script connects to the email server  
2. Attaches the required finance report  
3. Sends the email to the finance team automatically  

## What I Learned
- How to use Python to send emails securely  
- Automating repetitive reporting tasks  
- Making workflows faster and more reliable
